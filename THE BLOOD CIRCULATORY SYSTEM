The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood around the body.It is made up of the cardiac muscle that is myogenic, which means, it is self stimulated.The heart is divided into left and right by
a thick wall known as the septum.The heart is further divided  into four main chambers.Namely,THE RIGHT ATRIUM, THE RIGHT VENTRICLE, THE LEFT ATRIUM AND THE LEFT VENTRICLE.The right atrium receives
deoxygenated blood from all parts of the body via the superior and inferior venacava.The heart also contains valves that prevent the blackflow of blood by making flow in one direction.

Once the right atrium receives receives deoxygenated blood, it relaxes so as to receive the blood from the vena cava. This marks the beginning of the cardiac cycle which refers to the 
perfomance of the heart from one heart beat to the next.The right atrium then contracts to push the blood down to right ventricle. This forces the tricuspid valve to open and the pulmonary valve to close.
The right ventricle relaxes to receive the incoming blood.After this, it contracts to push the deoxygenated blood out of the heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs  for gaseous exchange. After gaseous exchange has occured,the 
oxygenated blood returns to the heart via the pulmanary vein. The left atrium relaxes to receive the blood and then contracts to push down the blood to the left ventricle which relaxes to receive the blood. The left ventricle then 
contracts to push blood to all parts of the body through the aorta.For this reason, the left ventricle is thicker than the right ventricle because it pumps blood at a high pressure and over a long distance.
The blood comes back to the heart as deoxygenated blood and the cycle begins all over again.

The movement of blood through the heart twice  to make a complete circulation is known as DOUBLE CIRCULATION. The relaxation of the walls of the heart is known as diastole while the contraction of the walls
of the heart is known as systole.
